Welcome to Magoou Publish -- Magoou.com's web content collection and profile engine. This file will be updated soon with more information on the engine and how to interface with it.

The reporter package is for collecting and profiling web contents.

The editor package is for selecting and suggesting contents based on user preferences.

The util package contains low level code for logging, some generic functions for mimicing linear algebra operations, and other used functions.

A storage package is used but not included in the repository. This is to keep the implementation flexible for other developers. You can use a database and interface you prefer as long as you output the data into dictionaries with the following keys:
entry: url, data source, language, type, author, datetime, title, summary, media, keywords {word:weight},
feed: url, type, datetime, keywords {word:weight}
user: username, password, location, preferences {word:weight}, datetime
issue: username, datetime, entries {entryid:score}, (public?)
usage - username, entryid, datetime, action
